# i-Grader

This project explores building an automated essay grading system using machine learning techniques to replicate human scoring. The plan aims to reduce teacher workload while providing instant scoring and feedback to students. The preprocessed essays were used to train three regression models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, and a Large Language Model. Another language model, RoBERTa, was also trained to detect AI-generated text in student submissions. A web application was developed with Flask to allow students to submit an essay and receive predicted scores from each trained model. This report details the model training process, evaluation of scoring accuracy, system architecture, and deployment. This project demonstrates the potential for automated essay-scoring systems to replicate human graders. The success of this project highlights its potential for broader applications in grading various written assignments within the educational domain.
